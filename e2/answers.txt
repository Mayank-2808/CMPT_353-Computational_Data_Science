1. The calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept' generates a Pandas Series with numerical values as the output. The y-coordinates of the points on the best-fit line are represented by this series. Since the values represent the outcome of a linear regression equation, their type is float. Based on the corresponding 'timestamp' and the linear regression model, each number in the series represents the expected rating. The best-fit line's location on the graph is determined by the sum of these values.

2. Because this equation represents the equation of a line (y = mx + b), where 'timestamp' is the x-coordinate, 'fit.slope' is the slope (m), and 'fit.intercept' is the y-intercept (b), the result is a line on the graph. The best-fit line that minimizes the discrepancy between the expected and actual scores has been identified using the linear regression analysis. The 'created_at' values and 'timestamp' values are paired correctly because 'timestamp' is derived from 'created_at' using the .timestamp() method, providing a numerical representation of time. The linear relationship between time and ratings is represented by this best-fit line.
