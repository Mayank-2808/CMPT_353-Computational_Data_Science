1. KNN and Random Forest models produced quite similar outcomes. But since Random Forest Classifier consistently produced better results, I decided that it was the best choice. We can select the optimal estimator by varying the number of them. The one that worked best for me was n_estimators = 200.

2. Yes, it appears that the model makes logical errors in its predictions. MeanÂ Temperature for each month is an additional factor that might enhance the forecast outcomes in addition to the ones already mentioned. The rationale is that, whereas the minimum and maximum temperatures only provide us with the extreme extremes, the mean temperature tends to provide a potentially useful general picture.
