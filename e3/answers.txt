1. I think I got a better result with Kalman smoothing while smoothing the CPU temperature, as the time series utilized in this particular database was very dynamic. Loess smoothing might prove to be more useful while observing local trends and fluctuations.

2. Timestamp, course and speed could have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude, as with the time stamp we would be able to estimate the time duration between consecutive observations, influencing the prediction. And the course might improve the prediction of the next position, especially in scenarios with changes in direction.
